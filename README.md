Diabetic_predictions



Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. 
The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, 
based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed 
on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are 
females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
We will explore this dataset and find out factors that contribute the most for diabetes causation.
We will also build Machine Learning Models that can help to predict whether a person is diabetic or 
not and try to improve the model by performing Cross Validation and hyperparameter tuning.
